Welcome to Zero to JupyterHub!

Before filing an issue, please search through the issues to see
if your question has been discussed before. If you
need more information after searching, feel
free to message us on the gitter channel. Many
JupyterHub community members watch the gitter channel
so you will have the benefit of other users' experience
as well as the JupyterHub team.

If you still wish to file an issue, please submit
as much detail about your issue as possible. If
you think it would be helpful, include a
scrubbed version of your `config.yaml` file. We've put
a place below where you can paste this in.

**WARNING**
Make sure you **remove all sensitive information** that's
in your `config.yaml` file, as GitHub is a public space.

Please remove at *least* the following fields:

* any special keys under auth
* proxy.secretToken
* hub.cookieSecret

If you post any sensitive information we reserve the
right to edit your comment in order to remove it.
