# Helm Chart Configuration Reference

The [JupyterHub helm chart](https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s) is configurable so that you can customize your JupyterHub setup however you'd like. You can extend user resources, build off of different Docker images, manage security and authentication, and more.

Below is a description of the fields that are exposed with the JupyterHub helm chart.
For more guided information about some specific things you can do with
modifications to the helm chart, see the [extending jupyterhub](extending-jupyterhub.html)
and [user environment](user-environment.html) pages.
