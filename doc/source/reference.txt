# Configuration Reference 

The [JupyterHub Helm
chart](https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s) is configurable by
values in your `config.yaml`. In this way, you can extend user resources, build off
of different Docker images, manage security and authentication, and more.

```eval_rst
Below is a description of the fields that are exposed with the JupyterHub Helm
chart. For more guided information about some specific things you can do with
modifications to the helm chart, see the :ref:`customization-guide`.
